    <h1>  History Of Galway</h1>

        Galway, one of the largest cities in Ireland, <br>

        situated on the west coast of Ireland,<br>

        has a complex history going back around 800 years. <br>

        The city was the only medieval city in the province of Connacht.
    </p>

    The city takes its name from that of the river,[1] the Gaillimh.<br>

     The word Gaillimh means "stony" as in "stony river". <br>

     Today, the river is commonly called the River Corrib, <br>

     after Lough Corrib, just to the north.<br>

      In Irish, Galway is also called Cathair na Gaillimhe ("city of Galway")<br>

      which is a modern creation to prevent confusion with Contae na Gaillimhe <br>

       County Galway which is often incorrectly called Gaillimh in Irish.</p>

<p>
            By the year 1232 it was held by the Anglo Normans under Richard de Burgo,<br>
            but constant flying raids by the various Clans in the region<br>
            brought about the need to build defensive walls.<br>
            The work was commenced and it was an immense task <br>
            given the small population of the town and the tools of the period.<br>
            By 1270 much of the walls were in place including the Spanish Arch itself, <br>
            and the town began to grow and prosper.<br>
            A charter was granted in 1396 by Richard II which transferre<br>
            governing powers to 14 merchant families, known locally as the 14 tribes of Galway.<br>
            Each of the 14 tribes maintained a quasi-independence,<br>
            while still retaining respectful links to the British crown.<br>
            Galway City is now known and “City of The Tribes”,<br>
            and the names of these fourteen tribes are now represented on roundabouts in Galway City.</p>
